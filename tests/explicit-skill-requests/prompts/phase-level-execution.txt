Great, the plan is complete. I've saved it to docs/plans/game-engine.md.

Here's a summary of what we designed:
- Phase 1: Camera System (3 tasks - camera follow, zoom levels, parallax)
- Phase 2: World Expansion (2 tasks - chunk loading, biome transitions)
- Phase 3: Entity System (4 tasks - base entity, player entity, NPC entity, collision)
- Phase 4: UI Framework (3 tasks - HUD, inventory, dialogue boxes)

Execution Options:
1. Autonomous (this session) - Runs all Phases to completion without stopping
2. Checkpoints (this session) - Pauses after each Phase for your approval
3. Batch Review (separate session) - Executes in separate worktree with human review

Which approach do you want?

Let's use subagent-driven-development with autonomous mode - dispatch a subagent per Phase, not per task.

[Your response should:
1. Use Phase-level language (not task-level)
2. Dispatch one subagent per Phase (2-6 tasks each)
3. Review after each Phase completes (spec + code quality)
4. NOT dispatch individual subagents per task]
