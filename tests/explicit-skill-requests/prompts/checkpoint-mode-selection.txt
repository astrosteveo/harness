Great, the plan is complete. I've saved it to docs/plans/auth-system.md.

Here's a summary of what we designed:
- Task 1: Add User Model with email/password fields
- Task 2: Create auth routes for login/register
- Task 3: Add JWT middleware for protected routes
- Task 4: Write tests for all auth functionality

Execution Options:
1. Autonomous (this session) - Runs to completion without stopping
2. Checkpoints (this session) - Pauses after each task for your approval
3. Batch Review (separate session) - Executes 3 tasks at a time

Which approach do you want?

I want to use checkpoints so I can review after each task
