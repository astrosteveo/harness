[Previous context - mid-execution of subagent-driven-development]

You've been implementing a plan at .harness/004-auth-system/plan.md using subagent-driven-development.
Progress so far:
- Phase 1: complete (3 tasks)
- Phase 2: complete (2 tasks)
- Phase 3: in-progress - just finished Task 3.1, about to start Task 3.2

I'm starting to notice my responses are getting slower and I'm having trouble keeping track of everything we've discussed. I think we should checkpoint this work before we hit context limits. Can you save our progress so we can resume later?

[Your response should:
1. Recognize this is context exhaustion
2. Create checkpoint at .harness/004-auth-system/checkpoint.md
3. Create PENDING_EXECUTION.md marker
4. Inform user to start new session for auto-resume]
