# Writing Documentation

## Overview

Documentation adds value or gets deleted. Every comment must tell you something the code doesn't.

**Core principle:** If removing the documentation loses no information, remove it.

## The Iron Law

```
NO DOCUMENTATION THAT RESTATES THE OBVIOUS
```

Comments explain WHY, not WHAT. The code shows WHAT.
